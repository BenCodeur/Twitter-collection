!! During the installation, do not forget to tick the option "Add Python to environment variables" in order to be able to execute the script from your CMD. !!

Once you have done it, open a CMD in the folder where you stored the script, then write the following commands (do not write the "-"). :
- pip install pandas
- pip install tweepy

You need both these 2 libraries in order to run the script.


## Usage

Open a CMD in the folder where you stored the script, then write the following command (do no write the "-"). :
- python TwitterCollection.py

All the tweets will be printed in the console. The code will also automatically generate a csv file "Twitter_Collection" to store all the tweets. This csv file will be in the folder from which you run the script.
